# Desafio Java JÃºnior - SimulaÃ§Ã£o GPS

This project was developed as a solution to a Java backend challenge presented in a YouTube video.  
It simulates a simplified GPS system where the goal is to process and return calculated routes between two points.

The challenge was designed to test backend development skills commonly required for **Junior Java Developer** roles, such as:

- Understanding of object-oriented programming
- Logical problem-solving
- Clean code and method structuring
- Handling input/output through the terminal or basic APIs

This repository represents one of my practice steps toward backend development with Java and demonstrates how I approach technical challenges.
